Hello, I made this API that has express, mongoose, dotenv, multer, cors and yup.

*Utility of each package*

* Express for building the web server.
* Mongoose to manipulate the database (MongoDB).
* Dotenv to protect database information (Username and Password)
* Multer to handle multipart/form-data.
* Cors is here releasing for everyone to consume the API.
* Yup for field validation.

This API was made with a housing booking site in mind. To enter the site you need an email to identify the user, soon after logging in there will be some functionality, they are:

  * Add house to reservation,
  * Edit some information of the house that is on the website,
  * Delete house from the site,
  * Book some house,
  * See available houses from a specific user.
